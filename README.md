# I-X Centre for AI in Science - Resources on Machine Learning and Deep Learning with Python (advanced topics)

This course introduces advanced topics in Deep Learning. It builds on  RCDS course [Deep Learning with Python](https://github.com/ASoelvsten/RCDS-Deep-Learning-CNN), and it is hence assumed that you are familiar with the basic PyTorch commands and Deep Learning concepts and terminology. In this course, we will explore more complex algorithms, ranging from graph neural networks (GNNs) over variational autoencoders (VAEs) to Bayesian neural networks. The course thus aim to present the breadth of Deep Learning techniques as well as to provide useful references for follow-up studies of the individual topics.

## Example and exercies, Google Colab

Below you will find the links to different notebooks on Google Colab sorted by topic. You can find more examples based on the fellow's mini-course series in the folder MINI-COURSES.
